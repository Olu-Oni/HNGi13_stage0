          <em> Hello, I'm Olu ðŸ‘‹</em> <br /><br />

          A web developer embarking on an exciting journey to master modern web
          technologies. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world
          problems and create meaningful connections. When I'm not coding,
          you'll find me exploring technologies (corely robotics), or
          experimenting with side projects. I'm committed to continuous learning
          and excited about the endless possibilities in web development.

        <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
        <p>
          Remember where you started from ...
          <br />
          <br />
          Now Look how far you've come! Every error message was a learning
          opportunity, every bug you fixed made you stronger. Don't be too hard
          on yourself when things don't work on the first try, that's part of
          the process. <br />Keep that curiosity alive, <br />Stay motivated
          (even find stronger motivations too!), <br />And never stop building....
          You've got this!ðŸ’ª

        <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          From what I've gathered, I believe this program represents more than
          just improving my tech skills, or getting a certificate.
          <br />
          it's about understanding the demands of a real-world jobs and
          projects. I'm particularly excited about the collaborative aspects of
          web development and looking forward to contributing to open-source
          projects. I believe that the best developers are those who share
          knowledge and lift others up. My goal is not just to become skilled,
          but to become part of a community that values learning, creativity,
          and innovation.
